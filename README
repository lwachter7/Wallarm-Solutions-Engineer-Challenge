Due to the integrations with Docker in gotestwaf, Wallarm, and httpbin.org I decided to use Docker as the environment

1. Deploy a Wallarm Filtering Node
Following the guide at: https://docs.wallarm.com/installation/inline/compute-instances/docker/nginx-based/
  a.Get Wallarm token of the appropriate type - I generated an api token with administrator permissions in the Wallarm API portal.
  b.Run docker container:
docker run -d -e WALLARM_API_TOKEN='XXXXXXX' -e WALLARM_LABELS='group=<GROUP>' -e NGINX_BACKEND='httpbin.org' -e WALLARM_API_HOST='us1.api.wallarm.com' -p 80:80 wallarm/node:6.0.0
image was pulled successfully 

2️. Set Up a Backend Origin - httpbin.org
Referencing 
docker pull kennethreitz/httpbin
docker run -p 80:80 kennethreitz/httpbin

Error - both httpbin.org and the Wallarm containers were trying to use the same local address - 0.0.0.0
Reconfigured both to use the private addess range 10.0.0.0/24 with httpbin.org container assigned to 10.0.0.1 and Wallarm node assigned to 10.0.0.2

Verified that backend was working by accessing 10.0.0.1 in web browser
